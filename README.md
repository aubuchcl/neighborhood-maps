make a branch and take out the responsive list functionality

go to -https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_filter_list - and implement search through the list

link the google maps marker functionality to the current list render by taking marker manufacturing out of the mapinit function / loop and putting it somewhere it can see the list and make decisions based on whats rendered.

figure out a third party api to use .........

store the data from the api in a string and use it to populate the marker infoWindow
